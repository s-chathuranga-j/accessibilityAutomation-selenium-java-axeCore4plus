# AXE (version 4.0 +) integration with Selenium Java

This is a Java Mevan project with the dependencies:
- Selenium
- TestNG
- WebDriverManager
- Axe-core

With AXE 4.0 onwards, the whole library changed and it become more easier to do things :) The syntax and the method names of the AXE-Core library changed when compare to versions before 4.0! This sample project includes codes with the latest (4.2.2 as of today) version of AXE Core library.

To run the code, open the project with IntelliJ (or any other preffered IDE) & locate the test files under the pakage "src/test/java/tests" You can simply run the test files from there

The AxeCore integration related code base is scripted in the AccessibilityBase class under the package "src/main/java/testbase"

A descriptive explanation about the code base can be found on Medium.com: https://medium.com/geekculture/integrate-axe-4-with-selenium-java-fbc36edd12b5
